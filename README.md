# Rev's Selenium Automation Framework

## Overview

Welcome to the Selenium Automation Framework! This framework is designed to simplify and streamline the process of automating web applications using Selenium WebDriver. It provides a structured foundation for writing and executing automated tests efficiently.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, enhancing test maintainability and reusability by encapsulating web elements and page interactions.

- **Test Data Management**: Easily manage test data through external data sources such as CSV, Excel, property file or databases.

- **Logging and Reporting**: Comprehensive test execution logs and detailed test reports are generated to track test results effectively.

- **Test Configuration**: Easily configure test parameters, such as browser choice and test environment, through configuration files.

- **Parallel Execution**: Execute tests in parallel for faster feedback and optimized test execution.

- **Customizable and Extensible**: The framework is highly customizable and extensible, allowing you to add custom utilities and modules as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before using this framework, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Java](https://www.java.com) (version 20 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) (for project management)
- [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) (WebDriver compatible with your browser choice)
- [TestNG](https://testng.org) (for test execution)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-automation-framework.git
   ```

2. Configure the project settings in the `config.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

3. Create test scripts in the `src/test/java` directory using the Page Object Model structure.

4. Run tests using Maven or your preferred IDE. To run tests in parallel, configure the `testng.xml` file accordingly.

## Usage

The following steps outline how to use this framework effectively:

1. **Page Objects**: Create page objects for web pages you intend to automate. These objects should extend the `BasePage` class and contain methods to interact with web elements.

2. **Test Scripts**: Write your test scripts using TestNG annotations. Inject page objects where necessary to perform interactions.

3. **Test Data**: Manage test data using the data-driven approach. Configure data sources and use the `DataProvider` class to fetch data.

4. **Execution**: Execute tests either through Maven or your preferred IDE. Monitor logs and review test reports in the `test-output` directory.

## Customization

This framework is highly customizable to fit your specific needs. You can extend the existing classes or add custom utilities and modules as required.

## Reporting

Test execution reports can be found in the `test-output` directory. These reports provide detailed insights into test results and can be customized to meet your reporting requirements.
